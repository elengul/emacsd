# EMACS setup

The .emacs file should go in what EMACS considers to be your home directory,
located here:

*c:\Users\[username]\AppData\Roaming\*

In that home directory, also create a directory called *.emacs.d* and a
sub-directory therein called *lisp*.  Place *init.el* and *nasm-mode.el*
in *lisp*.
